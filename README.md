# What is this?
This project is my attempt to isolate and create a scalable solution for game windows, menu, menu choices, dialogue boxes, dialogue choices, shop interfaces, whatever I can think of that requires windows and textboxes.

# Goal
I want to use this project as a longterm reference and sandbox for this particular topic. I hope to come back to this project and upgrade it as I learn more about GameMakerStudio 2 and how to make performant, maintainable, and scalable windowing.

# To Do
âœ… Create GMS2 project  
âœ… Push to Git as public repo (why not?? ðŸ˜‰)  
âœ… Set up basic 9-slice sprite and script  
âœ… basic textbox where user must press space to dismiss  
âœ… typewriter textbox effect with adjustable speed  
âœ… press space during typewriting (after, say, 2 characters have appeared, to automatically show all text)  
âœ… basic paging  
âœ… refactor: move paging / skipping logic to the struct  
â¬œ user selection from list of options  
â¬œ user input options as separate textbox, and pressing confirm on the option doesn't dismiss the underlying window (thinking about using a stack or something...)  
â¬œ accounts for word length and won't start writing on a line where it can't finish the word  
â¬œ data-driven message queuing for one window with paging, where space advances dialogue to next page  
â¬œ textbox feature to auto-page text that is too long for one window  
â¬œ ability to script text stop midway through and require space bar press to show rest of text  
â¬œ ability to colorize spans of text  
â¬œ optional nameplate  
â¬œ optional character bust picture  
â¬œ branching dialogue, scripting paths  
â¬œ RPG-style menu  
â¬œ RPG-style inventory  
â¬œ RPG-style shop interface  
â¬œ ...
